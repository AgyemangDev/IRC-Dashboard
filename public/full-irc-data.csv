"The French agricultural research and international cooperation organization working for the sustainable development of tropical and Mediterranean regions.","CIRAD","Research","","CIRAD  works with its partners to build knowledge and solutions and invent resilient farming systems for a more sustainable, inclusive world. It mobilizes science, innovation and training in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Its expertise supports the entire range of stakeholders, from producers to public policymakers, to foster biodiversity protection, agroecological transitions, food system sustainability, health (of plants, animals and ecosystems), sustainable development of rural territories, and their resilience to climate change.","CIRAD was founded in 1984 as a public establishment (EPIC), following a merger of French tropical agricultural research organizations, and is under the joint authority of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation and the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs. As such, it supports French science diplomacy operations. CIRAD works in some fifty countries on every continent.However, Africa is a priority in terms of CIRAD's missions and the long-term partnerships that have been established on that continent: research institutions, universities, farmers' organisations, NGOs, as well as regional institutions.
At European level, CIRAD is also involved in various European networks (Agrinatura, Euragri, Scar, etc.).
CIRAD has played a catalytic role in building dialogue between the EU and the AU, through various initiatives and projects (ERA-ARD, ProintensAfrica, LeapAgri, Leap4FNSAA and CEA-First).
He was one of the architects of the IRC, so it is entirely natural that he should be a member.","Elisabeth CLAVERIE DE SAINT MARTIN, Présidente Directrice Générale du Cirad","Sylvie LEWICKI","sylvie.lewicki@cirad.fr","1800","","","","42 rue Scheffer","","75116 PARIS","","","France","pdg@cirad.fr","0153702000","Checked","I confirm that my organisation accepts the obligations and terms of membership in the IRC","","Elisabeth CLAVERIE DE SAINT MARTIN","2025-02-14","",""

•	Connecting with a larger network of stakeholders in the research & development environment to pursue collaborative initiatives in this area, while identifying new funding opportunities: Apart from the CEA-FIRST project in which we are a partner, AgriCord is currently implementing the Farmers’ organisation led research and innovation on agroecology (FO-RI) financed by the EU. FO-RI includes 13 Action Research projects in 17 countries around the world (Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Cameroon, Burundi, RDC, Madagascar, Tanzania), in Asia (Philippines), in the Pacific (Fidji, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Tonga), in the Caribbean (Haiti) and in Latin America (Brazil et Uruguay) and 14 advocacy actions at regional level in five zones. We are also engaged in a collective action on agroecology with many stakeholders of researchers and practitioners. 
•	Knowledge exchange and scaling up research innovations: Interesting innovations are being tested and validated in the FO-RI initiative. Being part of IRC is an opportunity for knowledge exchange and to identify new funding opportunities for scaling up.
•	Access to visibility to showcase our strength as an alliance of 13 Agri-Agencies mandated by farmers’ organisations.","Pieter Verhelst - President","Katja Vuori - CEO","katja.vuori@agricord.org","9","3","6","0","Trierstraat 59-61","","Brussels","","","Belgium","INFO@AGRICORD.ORG","022392330","Checked","I confirm that my organisation accepts the obligations and terms of membership in the IRC","","Pieter Verhelst - President","2025-02-12","",""
