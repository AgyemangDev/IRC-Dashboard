"Polytechnic University of Coimbra","PUC","Academia","","Research and Teaching of Agriculture","Polytechnic University of Coimbra (PUC; in Portuguese, Instituto Politécnico de Coimbra) is a higher education institution in Portugal that offers education and develops research in agriculture sensu lato.

PUC had and has ongoing collaborations with African universities, especially in Portuguese speaking countries (Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde). These cover the education of farmers, promotion of entrepreneurship, and education on food technology, among others. In addition, PUC hosts a significant number of students in its bachelor's degrees from these countries every year, making strong ties with these countries.

The university's research agenda, in particular of its research center CERNAS (www.cernas.org),  aligns closely with the thematic priorities of the EU-AU FNSSA roadmap, including sustainable intensification, food systems for improved nutrition, and the enhancement of agricultural markets.

With a long record of experience in international research collaborations, PUC have demonstrated their capacity to effectively partner with institutions across Europe and Africa. Its participation in the Horizon and Erasmus projects and other bilateral initiatives highlights its ability to work across diverse cultural and institutional contexts. Additionally, the university has established itself as a hub for capacity development by offering training programs and mentoring opportunities to young researchers. This dedication to fostering a new generation of scientists, with an emphasis on supporting women and youth, aligns closely with the IRC's values and vision. PUC researchers have supervised several PhD students from African countries.

Therefore, PUC is well positioned to make significant contributions to the IRC through its expertise and strong commitment to advancing research and innovation in food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture.

The integration in IRC would open new doors to collaboration and complete the consortium with new competences that would enable it to further expand the African countries of collaboration and expand the competences of the consortium itself.","Marta Helena Fernandes Henriques - Director of i2A - Applied Research Institute of the Polytechnic University of Coimbra","Rui Manuel Machado da Costa","ruicosta@esac.pt","","","","","Rua da Misericórdia, Lagar dos Cortiços, S.
